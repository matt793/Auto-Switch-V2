# Auto-Switch-V2
Program a Cisco-Switch with a spreadsheet, and then walkaway to take care of other things: while Auto-Switch automates the work. The program works by automating your keyboard and opening up PuTTY network software.

## Getting Started
The first thing you will need is the software PuTTY. Auto-Switch works by automating PuTTY and the Cisco switch language. 
After installing PuTTY, then  place the PuTTY software to your <a href="https://docs.telerik.com/teststudio/features/test-runners/add-path-environment-variables" title="PATH">global PATH</a>!

Auto-Switch can now run out of the gate perfectly as is. It is now up to you how you want to set up your CSV database.
This repo will come a pre-set templet CSV file of pre-set date. You can then edit the file to your ideal setup. 

## COM Edit
In order to gane access to a Cisco terminal serial, you must have the correct COM number inputed. 
Find out what yours is by looking it up in your <a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/697936/5-ways-to-open-device-manager-on-windows-10/" title="Device Manager">Device Manager</a> under your connected <a href="https://pbxbook.com/voip/sputty.html" title="COM">COM port driver</a>.
After you find the correct COM number, input it into the CSV database cell. You can find the needed cell at column 13, row 2. Example below.

## Desktop Icon
The provided Appcation .exe file needs to stay inside the main folder, however, you can create a shortcut to the .exe file by right clicking on it and selecting create shortcut.
You can then drag the shortcut to your desktop. Example below.
